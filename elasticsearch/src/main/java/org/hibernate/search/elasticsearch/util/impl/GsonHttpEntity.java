/**
 * Optimised adapter to encode GSON objects into HttpEntity instances.
 * The naive approach was using various StringBuilders; the objects we
 * need to serialise into JSON might get large and this was causing the
 * internal StringBuilder buffers to need frequent resizing and cause
 * problems with excessive allocations.
 *
 * Rather than trying to guess reasonable default sizes for these buffers,
 * we can defer the serialisation to write directly into the ByteBuffer
 * of the HTTP client, this has the additional benefit of making the
 * intermediary buffers short lived.
 *
 * The one complexity to watch for is flow control: when writing into
 * the output buffer chances are that not all bytes are accepted; in
 * this case we have to hold on the remaining portion of data to
 * be written when the flow control is re-enabled.
 *
 * A side effect of this strategy is that the total content length which
 * is being produced is not known in advance.
